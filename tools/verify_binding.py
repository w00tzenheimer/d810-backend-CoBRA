"""Prove a built wheel actually solves, not merely that it imports.

Run by ``CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`` against every wheel cibuildwheel produces. This is
the only check separating a working wheel from one that installs cleanly and
simplifies nothing -- the failure this package exists to refuse.

Two things it deliberately does NOT do:

* It does not import ``d810_cobra.solve``. That module imports ``d810``, and
  the wheel is installed with ``PIP_NO_DEPS=1`` because this package requires
  ``d810-ng>=0.7.0``, which is not released yet. Testing through ``solve``
  would make the gate fail on a missing *runtime* dependency and say nothing
  about the binding.
* It does not check ``binding_available()``, a boolean that reports whether an
  import succeeded. A compiled extension can import and still be wrong; running
  a known-answer solve is what proves the C++ side is wired up.

The identity below is the smallest one that exercises the full path -- signature
evaluation, tree marshalling across the C ABI, the solver, and the result
decode. ``(x | y) - (x & y)`` is ``x ^ y`` for all inputs.
