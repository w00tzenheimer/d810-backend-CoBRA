"""CoBRA backend: solve linear MBA that d810's pattern catalogue cannot match.

d810's 203 ``mba-simplify`` transforms are pattern-matched identities.  On
coefficient-based linear MBA they fire zero times -- measured, not assumed.
CoBRA (github.com/trailofbits/CoBRA) is a signature-driven solver that closes
exactly that gap.

Layout mirrors what each piece needs:

* ``expr``   -- parse/evaluate/accept.  Pure data, no IDA, unit-testable.
* ``probe``  -- locate the cobra-cli binary, or report a structured skip.

Everything that touches ``ida_hexrays`` (candidate detection, microcode
reconstruction) lives outside this pure core so that unit tests can exercise
the logic without IDA, per the import-linter contract.

Design and measurements:

#: What d810's BackendRegistry reads to decide whether to load us.

#: Deliberately a plain dict rather than ``d810.core.plugins.BackendManifest``:
#: importing that would make d810 a hard import-time dependency of this
#: package, and would turn a d810 that predates the plugin protocol from
#: "backend not discovered" into a bare ImportError at startup. ``manifest_of``
#: accepts any mapping carrying these three keys.
#:
#: ``provides`` is a string, so it is resolved LAZILY -- a version-incompatible
#: d810 rejects us after reading three fields, without ever importing solve.py
#: and therefore without loading the compiled extension.
