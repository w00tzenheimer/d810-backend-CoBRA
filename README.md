CoBRA MBA-solver backend for [d810](https://github.com/w00tzenheimer/d810-ng) —
the `mba-solve` pass.

```console
pip install d810-cobra
```

That is the whole installation. d810 discovers this package automatically; no
configuration, no `COBRA_ROOT`, no CMake, no C++23 toolchain on the user's
machine.

> **Requires `d810-ng >= 0.7.0`, which is not released yet.**
> Discovery depends on `d810.core.plugins` and the `d810.backends` entry-point
> group. d810-ng 0.6.6 ships neither, so pip will refuse to install this
> package against it — deliberately. Version 0.1.0 declared `>=0.6.6`, which
> pip accepted, and the result was a package that installed, built its binding,
> and was then never discovered: `mba-solve` simply absent, indistinguishable
> from a pass that ran and matched nothing. A loud version error beats a silent
> no-op.

## Why it is a separate package

d810's 203 `mba-simplify` transforms are pattern-matched identities. On
coefficient-based linear MBA they fire zero times — measured, not assumed.
[CoBRA](https://github.com/trailofbits/CoBRA) is a signature-driven solver that
closes exactly that gap.

Shipping it inside d810 meant every d810 wheel carried a C++23 build of abseil,
highway and cobra-core, and CoBRA's version was pinned to a d810 commit. Split
out, d810's wheel stays pure and the two version independently.

## How d810 finds it

One entry point, in the unversioned `d810.backends` group:

```toml
[project.entry-points."d810.backends"]
cobra = "d810_cobra:MANIFEST"
```

```python
MANIFEST = {
    "name": "cobra",
    "api_version": 1,
    "provides": "d810_cobra.solve",
    "rules": ("d810_cobra.rules.cobra_solve",),
    "implements": {"mba-solve": "CobraSolveRule"},
}
```

`MANIFEST` is a plain dict — deliberately not d810's `BackendManifest`. The
package depends on d810 at runtime, but the *manifest* must not: importing
`BackendManifest` would turn "this d810 predates the plugin protocol" from a
clean "backend not discovered" into an ImportError during d810 startup.

Its `provides` is a *string*, resolved lazily, so a version-incompatible d810
rejects this backend after reading three fields — without importing `solve.py`
and therefore without loading the compiled extension.

`rules` and `implements` are what make the pass actually *run*, and each closes
a failure that is silent without it:

- **`rules`** — d810 registers its own optimizer rules by scanning
  `d810.optimizers.__path__`. That scan is path-scoped and cannot reach a rule
  living inside this package. Without declaring it, the backend reports
  `available` while `CobraSolveRule` never registers — indistinguishable from a
  pass that ran and matched nothing. d810 imports these only after the backend
  probes usable, so a missing binding yields no rule rather than a rule that
  raises on every call.
- **`implements`** — d810 derives a pass's `allowed_rule_names` from it at
  registration time, long before rules are imported; a rule outside that
  allowlist is skipped at dispatch. Declaring it here is what let d810 stop
  hardcoding `"CobraSolveRule"` in its own source. The key is d810's pass id
  (`d810.core.pass_ids.PassId.MBA_SOLVE`), written as a plain string so that
  declaring a manifest still requires no d810 import — `PassId` is a
  `StrEnum`, so the two compare and hash identically.

d810 itself is a hard dependency (`solve.py` uses `d810.core.getLogger`,
`table.py` uses `d810.core.cache`, `convert.py`/`detect.py` use
`d810.hexrays.*`). Some of those are d810 internals rather than a published
API, so a d810 refactor can break this package without either side bumping a
major version.

d810 ships no MBA solver of its own — `cobra` is not one of its builtin
backends — so this package supplies the `mba-solve` implementation rather than
overriding one:

```
cobra   available   d810-cobra 0.1.0
```

Check it with `d810cli backends`. Without this package installed, d810's
`mba-solve` pass resolves no implementation and contributes no stages.

## Building from source

```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/w00tzenheimer/d810-CoBRA
cd d810-CoBRA
python tools/build_cobra.py     # abseil + highway + cobra-core (CMake + Ninja)
pip install -e .
```

`tools/build_cobra.py` needs CMake and Ninja, and a C++23 compiler. On Windows
it pins MSVC (`cl`) explicitly: `-G Ninja` with no compiler pinned picks
whatever is first in `PATH`, and a MinGW build produces `libabsl_*.a` archives
that an MSVC-built `.pyd` can neither `/WHOLEARCHIVE:` nor safely link against.

The build **fails loudly** rather than producing a package without the binding.
A wheel that installs cleanly and simplifies nothing is the failure mode this
package exists to make impossible.

## Layout

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `src/d810_cobra/expr.py` | parse/evaluate/accept — pure data, no IDA |
| `src/d810_cobra/probe.py` | locate `cobra-cli`, or report a structured skip |
| `src/d810_cobra/solve.py` | the backend entry point d810 resolves |
| `src/d810_cobra/_cobra.pyx` | Cython binding over `cobra_shim.cpp` |
| `src/d810_cobra/rules/` | the `mba-solve` peephole rule (needs d810 + Hex-Rays) |
| `src/include/cobra_shim.h` | C ABI the binding compiles against |
| `src/cpp/cobra_shim.cpp` | C++ shim over cobra-core |
| `third_party/cobra` | pinned CoBRA submodule |

Headers and the C++ shim sit outside the package, mirroring d810's own
`src/include`. They are build inputs, so the wheel ships only what is
importable; `MANIFEST.in` is what carries them into the sdist. Note that
setuptools auto-includes a declared Extension *source* but never an
`include_dirs` header — drop `MANIFEST.in` and the sdist still contains
`cobra_shim.cpp` while silently losing `cobra_shim.h`.

Everything that touches `ida_hexrays` lives under `rules/`, so the solver core
stays unit-testable without IDA.
